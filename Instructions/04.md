# Exercise 4: Azure Server Management Services

Azure server management services provide a consistent experience for managing servers at scale. These services cover both Linux and Windows operating systems. They can be used in production, development, and test environments. The server management services can support Azure IaaS virtual machines, physical servers, and virtual machines that are hosted on-premises or in other hosting environments.

#### Task 1: Enable server management services on a VM

1.	Onboard Update Management, Change Tracking, and Inventory solutions to Azure virtual machine

#### Task 2: Create Update Schedules (Update management)

#### Task 3: Guest Configuration Policy 

In this task you will use the Azure Policy Guest Configuration extension to audit the configuration settings in a virtual machine to verify that password security settings in Windows and Linux computers are set correctly.

1. From the **Azure portal** open the cloud shell session.

2. Select the powershell session 

3. Connect to your azure account by running the command:
   ```
   Connect-AzAccount 
    ```
4. Set the subscription to be used by running the below command:
   
   ```
   $Subscription = Get-AzSubscription | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*sub 05*"  } | Sort-Object -Property Name
   $scope = "/subscriptions/" + $Subscription.Id
   ```

5. Verify that password security settings in Windows and Linux computers are set correctly.

```
$PasswordPolicy = Get-AzPolicySetDefinition -Name "3fa7cbf5-c0a4-4a59-85a5-cca4d996d5a6"
New-AzPolicyAssignment -Name "PasswordPolicy" -DisplayName "[Preview]: Audit that password security settings are set correctly inside Linux and Windows machines" -Scope $scope -PolicySetDefinition $PasswordPolicy -AssignIdentity -Location centralus
```

 6. Verify that certificates aren't close to expiration on Windows VMs.
 
 ```
 $CertExpirePolicy = Get-AzPolicySetDefinition -Name "b6f5e05c-0aaa-4337-8dd4-357c399d12ae"
 New-AzPolicyAssignment -Name "CertExpirePolicy" -DisplayName "[Preview]: Audit that certificates are not expiring on Windows VMs" -Scope $scope -PolicySetDefinition $CertExpirePolicy -AssignIdentity -Location centralus
 ```

#### Task 4: Enable Tracking and Alerting for Critical Changes

Azure Change Tracking and Inventory provide alerts on the configuration state of your hybrid environment and changes to that environment. It can report critical file, service, software, and registry changes that might affect your deployed servers.

By default, the Azure Automation inventory service doesn't monitor files or registry settings. The solution does provide a list of registry keys that we recommend for monitoring.

1.	Set Alerts on file or registry changes in the VM.
