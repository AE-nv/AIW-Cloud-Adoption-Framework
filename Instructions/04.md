# Exercise 4: Operations Management

## Context
Azure server management services provide a consistent experience for managing servers at scale. These services cover both Linux and Windows operating systems. They can be used in production, development, and test environments. The server management services can support Azure IaaS virtual machines, physical servers, and virtual machines that are hosted on-premises or in other hosting environments.

In this exercise, you will cover how to Onboard Change Tracking, Inventory, and Update Management solutions to Azure virtual machine

>Note: To onboard the server management services Azure **Update Management, Change Tracking and Inventory**, **log analytics workspace, automation account, and virtual machine**  are required and these are already provided as pre-requisite in the resource group **CAF**.

>You will be using the subscription **Sub 05 - Suffix** and the resource group **CAF** for this exercise.

#### Task 1: Enable server management services on a Virtual Machine

In this task, you will enable all service management services Change Tracking, Inventory, and Update Management on a virtual machine.

#### Subtask1: Enable Change Tracking and Inventory on a Virtual Machine

Azure **Change Tracking and Inventory** provide alerts on the configuration state of your hybrid environment and changes to that environment. It can report critical files, service, software, and registry changes that might affect your deployed servers. By default, the Azure Automation inventory service doesn't monitor files or registry settings. The solution does provide a list of registry keys that we recommend for monitoring.

A **Log Analytics workspace** is a unique environment for storing Azure Monitor log data. Each workspace has its own data repository and configuration. Data sources and solutions are configured to store their data in particular workspaces. Azure monitoring solutions require all servers to be connected to a workspace so that their log data can be stored and accessed.

The management services require an **Azure Automation account**. You use this account, and the capabilities of Azure Automation, to integrate Azure services and other public systems to deploy, configure, and manage your service management processes.

In this section, you will enable consistent control and compliance of your VMs with Change Tracking and Inventory.

1. In the upper left corner of the portal window, to open the Resource Groups menu, click the toggle menu icon and then click on **Resource groups**.

   ![](images/ex4-windowsfileadd.png)

4. On the **Add Windows File for Change Tracking pane**, enter the information for the file or folder to track and click **Save**. 
   - Item name: `hosts`  that is the name of the file to be tracked.
   
   - Enter path: `C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts*` that is the path to check for the file hosts.
   
   - Path type: Choose **Folder**

   - Recursion: **On**
     >True if recursion is used when looking for the item to be tracked, and False otherwise.

   - Upload File content: **True**
   
     >True to upload file content on tracked changes, and False otherwise.
   
   ![](images/ex4-widnowsfilesave.png)

5. After adding the file to track, the next step is to enable tracking for file content changes.
  
   >Note: File content tracking allows you to view the contents of a file before and after a tracked change. The feature saves the file contents to a storage account after each change occurs.
  
6. On the **Workspace Configuration** page switch to **File Content** tab and click on **Link**, this selection opens the **Add Content-Location for Change Tracking** page.

   >Linking a storage account is required to save the content of the file modified.
   
   ![](images/ex4-filecontent.png)

   ![](images/ex4-addcontent.png)
  
8. Select **On** for Upload file content for all settings and then Click on **Save**.

9. Now on the virtual machine navigate to the path **C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hostsC:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts** and open the file with **Notepad** 
   
   ![](images/ex4-path.png)
   
10. Edit the file **hosts** by editing the values in order to check how **Change Tracking** solution tracks the file.
   
    ![](images/ex4-edithosts.png)
   
    >For example if the value is  38.25.63.10, modify the value by modifying the last digit 38.25.63.11

11. Now return to azure portal and go to the **autoac-DeploymentID** **Automation account** blade 

12. From the **autoac-DeploymentID**  **Automation account** page scroll down to **Monitoring** section and select **Logs**.
  
    ![](images/ex4-logs.png)
   
13. Now on the **Automation account| Logs** blade click on **Select a scope** and set the scope to the virtual machine **labvm-DeploymentID** and click on **Apply**.
  
    ![](images/ex4-logs-vm.png)

14. In Log Analytics, paste the following query and Click on **Run** to search for changes to the hosts file:
    ```
    ConfigurationChange | where FieldsChanged contains "FileContentChecksum" and FileSystemPath contains "hosts"
    ```
    ![](images/ex4-query.png)
   
   >This query searches for changes to the contents of files that have a path that contains the word "hosts."
   
#### Task 2: Guest Configuration Policy 

In this task, you will use the Azure Policy Guest Configuration extension to audit the configuration settings in a virtual machine to verify that password security settings in Windows and Linux computers are set correctly and also to check whether any certificates are about to expire.
Use the PowerShell commands to deploy these policies to:
- Verify that password security settings in Windows and Linux computers are set correctly.
- Verify that certificates aren't close to expiration on Windows VMs.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

    ```
7. Set the scope where you will be applying the policies to by running the below command:
   
   ```
   $Subscription = Get-AzSubscription | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*sub 05*"  } | Sort-Object -Property Name
   $scope = "/subscriptions/" + $Subscription.Id
   ```

8. **Assign** the available policy definition **Verify that password security settings in Windows and Linux computers are set correctly** by running the below command:
   ```
   $PasswordPolicy = Get-AzPolicySetDefinition -Name "3fa7cbf5-c0a4-4a59-85a5-cca4d996d5a6"
   New-AzPolicyAssignment -Name "PasswordPolicy" -DisplayName "[Preview]: Audit that password security settings are set correctly inside Linux and Windows machines" -Scope     $scope -PolicySetDefinition $PasswordPolicy -AssignIdentity -Location centralus
   ```

 9. **Assign** the available policy definition **Verify that certificates aren't close to expiration on Windows VMs** by running the below command:
    ```
    $CertExpirePolicy = Get-AzPolicySetDefinition -Name "b6f5e05c-0aaa-4337-8dd4-357c399d12ae"
    New-AzPolicyAssignment -Name "CertExpirePolicy" -DisplayName "[Preview]: Audit that certificates are not expiring on Windows VMs" -Scope $scope -PolicySetDefinition     $CertExpirePolicy -AssignIdentity -Location centralus

#### Task 3: Create Update Schedules 

Creating update schedules to schedule the installation of updates to ensure that all the servers have the latest ones and can quickly assess the status of available updates on all agent machines and manage the process of installing required updates for servers. 

In this task, you will deploy and install software updates on machines that require the updates by creating a scheduled deployment. Updates classified as optional aren't included in the deployment scope for Windows machines, Only required updates are included in the deployment scope. The scheduled deployment defines which target machines receive the applicable updates

The following are the steps to schedule an update on a virtual machine.

1. Navigate to **Automation account** blade and under the **Update management** section and then select **Update management**.
